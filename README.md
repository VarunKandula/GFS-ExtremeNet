# GFS-ExtremeNet
GFS-ExtremeNet:Designed for microscopic image detection, nucleus and three types of parasites include trypansoma, toxoplasma and babesia are tested in our model.

Our GFS-ExtremeNet is proposed based on [ExtremeNet code]( https://github.com/xingyizhou/ExtremeNet)

Some test results are as follows:
